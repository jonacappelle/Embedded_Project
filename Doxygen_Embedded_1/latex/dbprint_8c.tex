\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item v1.\+0\+: \char`\"{}define\char`\"{} used to jump between V\+C\+OM or other mode, itoa ($<$stdlib.\+h$>$) used aswell as stdio.\+h \item v1.\+1\+: Separated print\+Int method in a separate function for printing \char`\"{}int32\+\_\+t\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}uint32\+\_\+t\char`\"{} values. \item v1.\+2\+: Added more options to the initialize method (location selection \& boolean if V\+C\+OM is used). \item v2.\+0\+: Restructured files to be used in other projects, added a lot more documentation, added \char`\"{}db\+Alert\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}db\+Clear\char`\"{} methods. \item v2.\+1\+: Added interrupt functionality. \item v2.\+2\+: Added parse functions, separated method for printing uint values in a separate one for D\+EC and H\+EX notation. \item v2.\+3\+: Updated documentation. \item v2.\+4\+: Fixed notes. \item v2.\+5\+: Separated method for printing int values in a separate one for D\+EC and H\+EX notation. \item v2.\+6\+: Stopped using itoa ($<$stdlib.\+h$>$) in all methods. \item v3.\+0\+: Simplified number printing, stopped using separate methods for uint and int values. \item v3.\+1\+: Removed useless if... check. \item v3.\+2\+: Added the ability to print text in a color. \item v3.\+3\+: Added info, warning and critical error printing methods. \item v3.\+4\+: Added print\+Int(\+\_\+hex) methods that directly go to a new line. \item v3.\+5\+: Added U\+S\+A\+R\+T0 I\+RQ handlers. \item v3.\+6\+: Added the ability to print (u)int values as I\+N\+FO, W\+A\+RN or C\+R\+IT lines. \item v3.\+7\+: Added separate \char`\"{}\+\_\+hex\char`\"{} methods for dbinfo/warn/crit\+Int instead of a boolean to select (hexa)decimal notation. \item v3.\+8\+: Added Read\+Char-\/\+Int-\/\+Line methods. \item v3.\+9\+: Added \char`\"{}void\char`\"{} between argument brackets were before nothing was. \item v4.\+0\+: Added more documentation. \item v4.\+1\+: Added color reset before welcome message. \item v5.\+0\+: Made uint-\/char conversion methods static, moved color functionality to enum, started moving interrupt functionality to use getters and setters. \item v5.\+1\+: Fixed interrupt functionality with getters and setters. \item v6.\+0\+: Cleaned up interrupt functionality and added some documentation. (put some code in comments to maybe fix later if ever necessary) \item v6.\+1\+: Made {\ttfamily dbpointer} a local variable (removed {\ttfamily extern}). Removed {\ttfamily extern} from the documentation. \item v6.\+2\+: Removed {\ttfamily static} before the local variables (not necessary).\end{DoxyItemize}
